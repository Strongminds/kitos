# Code quality

KITOS uses one quality gate for developers, AI agents and CI:

| Where | How |
|---|---|
| Locally / AI agents | `pwsh ./scripts/quality-check.ps1` |
| Pull requests to `master` | `.github/workflows/pr-quality.yml` (runs the same script) |
| IDE | Rules from `.editorconfig` show live in Visual Studio / Rider / VS Code |

## What is checked

1. **Formatting** – `dotnet format whitespace` on changed `*.cs` files only (legacy files are fixed when touched).
2. **Build with 0 warnings** – `KITOS.sln` and `Kitos_PubSub.sln` are built with `-p:KitosQualityGate=true`, which turns every compiler and analyzer warning into an error. The rules live in `.editorconfig`; `Directory.Build.props` enables the .NET analyzers and code style in build for all projects.
3. **KITOS conventions** on the diff against the merge base with `origin/master` (committed, uncommitted, untracked **and deleted** files):
   - no `Console.Write*` / `Debug.Write*` / `Debugger.Break` in production code (FAIL)
   - warning suppressions need a justification: `#pragma warning disable` with a `// reason` on the same line or the line above; `[SuppressMessage(...)]` (also multi-line) with a non-empty `Justification` (FAIL)
   - added/deleted EF Core migrations come with their `.Designer.cs` and an updated `KitosContextModelSnapshot.cs` (FAIL)
   - added/changed/deleted SQL scripts → verify SQL Server and PostgreSQL versions (WARN)
   - business logic (`Core.*`, `Presentation.Web/Controllers`, `PubSub.Core.*`, `PubSub.Application.*`) changed or deleted without test changes (WARN)
   - analyzer rules relaxed (WARN – needs reviewer approval). The effective severities in every changed, added or deleted `.editorconfig`/`.globalconfig` are compared with the merge base: lowered or removed enforced rules, demoted naming/category-wide severities and changed naming definitions are reported; removing baseline entries or promoting rules is not. Changes to warning/analyzer MSBuild properties (`NoWarn`, `TreatWarningsAsErrors`, `AnalysisLevel`, …), added/deleted `Directory.Build.*` files and changes to the gate itself are reported as well.
4. **Unit tests** – `Tests.Unit.Core.ApplicationServices`, `Tests.Unit.Presentation.Web` and `PubSub.Test`.

The gate stops with an error if the merge base cannot be resolved (e.g. failed fetch), instead of silently checking only local changes.

Useful switches: `-Fix` (apply formatting), `-SkipBuild`, `-SkipTests`, `-BaseRef origin/master`.

Normal local and Docker builds are unaffected – analyzer findings show as warnings there and only fail with `KitosQualityGate=true`.

## Rule policy (ratchet)

`.editorconfig` severities:

- `warning` – enforced. Only rules with **zero** violations in the codebase are enforced, so the build is green from day one.
- `suggestion` – shown in the IDE only. These rules still have existing violations.

To tighten the gate:

1. Pick a `suggestion` rule (or a rule from the `latest-recommended` set), fix its violations.
2. Promote it to `warning` in `.editorconfig` in the same PR.

Never demote a rule to make a PR pass. The **baseline** section in `.editorconfig` lists pre-existing violations in specific files; entries are only removed (when fixed), never added.

## AI agents

`.github/copilot-instructions.md` contains a mandatory *Definition of done*: agents must run the gate, fix failures and re-run until it passes, and self-review using `.github/skills/code-quality/SKILL.md`, which covers KITOS conventions analyzers cannot check (`Result`/`Maybe`, authorization, transactions, domain events, mappers, tests).

## Making the gate required

In GitHub → *Settings → Branches → master* branch protection, add **Format, analyzers, conventions and unit tests** as a required status check.
