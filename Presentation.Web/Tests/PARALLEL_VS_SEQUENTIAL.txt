By default all tests should be placed in the "Parallel" folder which is targeted by the parallel test job.

If the test cannot be executed in parallel with others (e.g. it depends on transient state/needs full control), place it in the "sequential" folder

If possible, rewrite sequential tests to be enabled for parallel execution.
